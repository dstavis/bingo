# Interactive Bingo
## Goal:
### A bingo game playable in the web browser.

Features:
- can receive a number of inputs that is higher than the total number of boxes on the bingo card itself
  - will fill each card with a randomly selected subset of facts from the total pool of facts
  - will place the facts into boxes in a random order

- each card has 16 bingo boxes (4x4 grid), and thus displays at most 16 out of a total 30 unique facts
- each fact text fits neatly inside the bingo box that contains it, is easy to read, and looks good
- the user can mark a bingo box complete, making it contribute to their victory
- when a box is marked complete, it changes visually so that it's easy to tell it's complete
- the user can write text on a bingo box that is separate from the fact in that box. this text field can be used for, at the very least, writing the name of the person they think the fact corresponds to

- the background is the canva art designed by Emily
